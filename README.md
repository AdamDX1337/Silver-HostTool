# Installation Guide
1. Get an Injector (I recommend extreme injector)
2. Put the DLL into the injector
3. Click on HOI4 from Process or Window List
4. Inject (Known Issue, injecting after game loads SOMETIMES crashes, always inject as the game is loading)

## Features
### All of these features ONLY work if you are playing as a host in an MP game
1. Tagswitch
2. Enabling or Disabling AI
3. Enable or Disable buttons (Press Disable than Enable in the lobby to fix game)

Not sure what other features a host would need that isn't provided by a hosttool mod.
